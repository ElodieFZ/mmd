=== Interpretation of child and parent relationship

If a dataset has a <related_dataset relation_type=”parent”> element it
means that the referred dataset is this datasets parent. This
relationship does not impose any specific characteristics on either the
parent or the child dataset. For instance it is not required that the
parents dataset is a dataset series and that the child dataset is a
dataset within the series. The relationship only causes the child
dataset to inherit elements from the parent dataset. Exact semantics for
inheritance is to be decided.
