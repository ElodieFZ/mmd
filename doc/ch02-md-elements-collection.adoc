|Description a|
The purpose of this tag is the same as for the ownertag in XMD files. It
is used to identify which collection a dataset belong to. This is used
to identify sets when serving metadata through e.g. OAI-PMH or to
identify which data to present in e.g. a project specific portal when
all metadata records are in the same repository.

The keyword used to identify the collection should be short (e.g. NMDC,
NMAP, SIOS, ...). See <<collection-keywords>> for details.
